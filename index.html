              <p>
                This is a website about Kodi. My the longest time,
                she had been the love of my life, until one fateful
                evening all hell broke loose.
              </p>

              <p>
                I miss Kodi from time to time. But oh well, we shall
                meet on the other side, perhaps
              </p>

              This is a blog website about my experiences in life as a Christian.
              All thoughts and articles reflect my state of mins at the time
              and my feelings towards the relative subject, unless changed in 
              follow up posts.

              This is a story about a wandering heart and how we've become so accustomed
              to what we take as truth other than what scripture portrays.
              Cleanliness is next to Godliness they said, err and it's definitely not in
              scripture. You know...
